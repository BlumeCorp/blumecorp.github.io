# Alternate Account Creation Guide
### A twelve-step guide on creating effective espionage accounts.

#### Step 1: Naming
Try to use only one capital letter. You can use a [word generator](http://www.wordgenerator.net/random-word-generator.php) to generate good names.

#### Step 2: Profile
Start establishing a backstory. Put a fake age, some interests, and update your status frequently!

#### Step 3: Jobs
Establish a few low-level jobs and **maybe** one higher-level job.
Look specifically for the types of groups that'll give you a rank upon your joining.

Examples include:
- Aroon's Cafe
- The Robine
- Pinewood Builders Security Team

#### Step 4: Games
Play some popular, front-page games. You can also play other games (maybe try the ones your enemy group has)!

Examples include:
- Ultimate Driving: Westover Islands
- Phantom Forces
- Prison Life
- Redwood Prison
- NUSA District of Columbia
- Pinewood Builders Computer Core

#### Step 5: Gamepasses
Buy some popular gamepasses. Use mostly cheaper ones (R$300 and under) but get maybe *one* larger gamepass, like the OP weapons pass at PBCC.

Examples include:
- OP Weapons Pass at PBCC (R$4,004)
- Riot Police Pass at Prison Life (R$200)
- Police/Fire/DOT Pass(es) at Ultimate Driving: Westover Islands (R$165 collectively)

#### Step 6: Badges
Earn badges on some obstacle courses (*obbys*), or on popular games!

Examples include: 
- Abomination badge at PBCC
- Meltdown badge at PBCC
- Visitor badge at PBCC

#### Step 7: Clothes
***Don't ever wear a package. Ever. Ever. Ever.***

#### Step 8: Models
Take popular free models from famous creators like [TwentyTwoPilots](https://www.roblox.com/users/795186/profile) and [Diddleshot](https://www.roblox.com/users/390939/profile).

#### Step 9: Places
Use place templates from Roblox, but find ways to customize them and make them yours!

#### Step 10: Friends
Meet intelligent, skilled people, but also friend some noobs. Do not form attachments to these friends, as they are "throwaway" friends, and do not matter.

#### Step 11: Establishment
Get used to living in the life of your alt. Think of them as a separate person, with hobbies, likes, and dislikes.

#### Step 12: Never Burn
Don't **ever** reveal your true intentions, as that costs you money, time and trust (the trust of your enemies).
