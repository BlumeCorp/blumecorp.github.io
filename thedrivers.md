# The Drivers
## Startup Plan

### Staff
We will have:

- Moderators-in-Training
  - entry-level mods given little power
- Moderators
  - proven mods given some power
- Moderator Hiring Manager(s)
  - specialty position assigned to a Moderator Supervisor who reads moderator applications and provides a decision as to hiring
- Moderator Supervisors
  - trusted staff who observe and mentor moderators
- Administrators
  - highly trusted staff given most power
- Board of Executives
  - fully trusted staff given all powers
  
  In addition to these new ranks, we will introduce a democratic system of votes and motions to ensure uniform decision-making.
  
  ### Decision-Making Protocols
  Any staff member may propose a motion. The motion will consist of a short Discord brief in the **#motions** channel and an accompanying Google document, created using the existing template. In most cases, votes must obtain a **majority** vote (more than 1/2 of the entire staff team), except in certain special cases.
  In such cases, a **supermajority** vote (more than 2/3 of the entire staff team) must be obtained. 
  Voters may use three options: 
  - **Yes**
  - **No**
  - **Acceptance pending revision (APR)**
  **Acceptance pending revision** refers to the voter wishing to accept the motion pending a certain amendment being added.
  Reasoning must be provided for all three options.
  
  ### Staff Applications
  We will design comprehensive staff applications that challenge the applicant to truly think and reason. The **Moderator Hiring Manager** will be responsible for reviewing applications every week. The Moderator Hiring Manager will present their choice(s) to the Board of Executives, who will then review the applicant and vote on their entry.
  
  ### Developers
  We will also hire game developers to work on our group facilities. Developers will be assigned deadlines and guidelines. If a developer fails to meet deadlines, they will be required to provide reasoning for the issue. Violation of developer guidelines will result in an internal review being conducted by the Chief Developer.
